The recent suicide of Aaron Swartz, pushed me into a state of sadness
I never felt before for a human being I never met face to face.

Throughout these days I keep thinking and wondering about the cause of such a feeling.
I found myself reading again and again the blog posts meaning the most to me, trying to catch every
single nuance of his words and thought: Aaron is inspiring and insightful.

Having a deep admiration for the strength and the courage of this young boy, I esteem his force to
*take action* to change the world and fighting for the causes he cared about.
Absolutely Aaron Swartz was a role model in this context, and I could strive to be more like him.
